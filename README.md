# rijkshuisstijl-frontend

Dutch Government Rijkshuisstijl front-end setup.

See "examples" folder .html files for examples of:

1. article: basic page layout
2. index: homepage layout
3. listing: listing page layout

Basic Bolt CMS templates are there as well. This project can be added to a bolt installation as a theme. However, currently this has been set up as frontend only, Bolt theme requires more dev to be complete. Is ideal for startup though, as a Bolt Rijkshuisstijl theme
